### README for Movie Recommendation System Project

#### Overview
This project develops algorithms to recommend movies based on user preferences extracted from provided training data. It implements collaborative filtering methods including User-Based and Item-Based techniques.

#### Data
- **Training Data (`train.txt`)**: Ratings from 200 users on 1000 movies.
- **Test Data (`test5.txt`, `test10.txt`, `test20.txt`)**: Ratings from 100 users; tasks involve predicting ratings for movies not yet rated by these users.

#### Collaborative Filtering Algorithms
1. **User-Based Collaborative Filtering**: Implemented with Cosine similarity and Pearson Correlation methods. Extensions include Inverse User Frequency and Case Modification.
2. **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering**: Utilizes adjusted cosine similarity to predict ratings.

#### Custom Algorithm
- Details and implementation of a novel algorithm for enhancing recommendation performance.

#### Evaluation
- Performance is evaluated based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE) from an online grading system.

#### Results and Discussion
- Comparative analysis of various algorithms, discussing their strengths, weaknesses, and accuracy.

#### Running the Code
- Instructions on how to execute the programs and scripts included in this project.

#### Submission
- Ensure to submit both the code and a comprehensive report detailing the methodologies, results, and insights from the experiments.

This project not only tests different recommendation techniques but also invites innovative approaches to enhance the accuracy of movie suggestions.
